**Hiring Manager**  
Telia

**Re: DevOps Engineer Position**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the DevOps Engineer position. With 8+ years of hands-on experience in CI/CD automation, cloud infrastructure, and Agile methodologies, I am excited to contribute to your team's success in delivering reliable, scalable, and efficient solutions.

In my current role at Stena Metall, I have successfully automated infrastructure provisioning using Terraform and Azure Pipelines, reducing manual tasks by 40%. I implemented cost optimization strategies using Azure Advisor and Azure Policies, achieving 30% reduction in non-compliant resources. My experience spans CI/CD pipeline design in Azure DevOps, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions, consistently improving deployment efficiency and reliability.

I specialize in building robust CI/CD pipelines across multiple platforms including Azure DevOps, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI. My approach to DevOps emphasizes automation, security integration (DevSecOps), and continuous improvement. I have successfully implemented GitOps workflows with ArgoCD and maintained high-availability systems.


Telia's position as a telecommunications leader and your commitment to digital transformation resonates with my passion for building scalable, reliable infrastructure. Your focus on Agile methodologies and innovative technology solutions matches my experience in fast-paced, customer-focused environments.


I am eager to bring my passion for automation, cloud excellence, and continuous improvement to your team. I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to your organization's continued success and growth.

Sincerely,  
**Arnab Dey**

**Hiring Manager**  
Telia Company

**Re: Senior DevOps Engineer Position**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the DevOps Engineer position. With 8+ years of hands-on experience in CI/CD automation, cloud infrastructure, and Agile methodologies, I am excited to contribute to your team's success in delivering reliable, scalable, and efficient solutions.

In my current role at Stena Metall, I have successfully automated infrastructure provisioning using Terraform and Azure Pipelines, reducing manual tasks by 40%. I implemented cost optimization strategies using Azure Advisor and Azure Policies, achieving 30% reduction in non-compliant resources. My experience spans CI/CD pipeline design in Azure DevOps, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions, consistently improving deployment efficiency and reliability.

I specialize in building robust CI/CD pipelines across multiple platforms including Azure DevOps, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI. My approach to DevOps emphasizes automation, security integration (DevSecOps), and continuous improvement. I have successfully implemented GitOps workflows with ArgoCD and maintained high-availability systems.


Your organization's commitment to technological excellence and innovation aligns perfectly with my passion for delivering high-quality solutions. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team's success and help drive your technology initiatives forward.


I am eager to bring my passion for automation, cloud excellence, and continuous improvement to your team. I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to your organization's continued success and growth.

Sincerely,  
**Arnab Dey**

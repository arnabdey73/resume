**Hiring Manager**  
Nordcloud

**Re: Cloud Architect Position**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Cloud Architect position. With 8+ years of experience designing and implementing Azure cloud solutions, cost optimization strategies, and leading cross-functional teams, I am well-positioned to drive your cloud transformation initiatives.

Throughout my career, I have architected and implemented cloud solutions across Azure and AWS platforms. At Volvo Cars, I automated Azure Databricks cluster scaling with cost-aware resource management, while upgrading enterprise infrastructure for Kubeflow workloads. My expertise in Azure CAF, governance frameworks, and cost optimization has enabled organizations to achieve both technical excellence and financial efficiency.

My Azure expertise encompasses IaaS, PaaS services, Entra ID integration, Logic Apps, and comprehensive cost management through Azure Cost Management and Azure Advisor. I have implemented governance frameworks using Azure Policies and have hands-on experience with Azure Monitor, KQL queries, and Azure security best practices.


I am particularly drawn to Nordcloud's reputation as a leading cloud consultancy and your focus on helping organizations maximize their cloud investments. Your emphasis on FinOps practices and customer-centric approach aligns perfectly with my experience in cost optimization and stakeholder engagement.


I would be delighted to discuss specific technical challenges your team is facing and how my experience with cloud architecture, DevOps practices, and automation can provide solutions. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
**Arnab Dey**

**Subject:** Application for Senior DevOps Engineer

Dear Jasin,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior DevOps Engineer position at Telia. With 8+ years of **CI/CD automation** and cloud infrastructure experience, I bring expertise in **Agile/SAFe methodologies** and Azure-native DevOps solutions that align with Telia's digital transformation goals.

My recent work includes designing **CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps** (reducing deployment times by 30%), automating infrastructure with **Terraform and Kubernetes**, and serving as **Product Owner** in **SAFe environments**. I've delivered scalable solutions at AFRY, Stena Metall, and Capgemini (Volvo Cars), combining technical execution with **Agile collaboration** across cross-functional teams.

What excites me about Telia is the opportunity to contribute to secure, modern platforms while leveraging my **CI/CD expertise** and **Agile leadership** experience to enable faster, more reliable service delivery.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background can support Telia's DevOps initiatives.

Sincerely,  
**Arnab Dey**

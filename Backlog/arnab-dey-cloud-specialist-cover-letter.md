Recruitment Lead  
Redeploy  

**Subject:** Application for Cloud Specialist  

Dear Francisca,  

I am excited to apply for the Cloud Specialist position at Redeploy. With over 8 years of experience in **cloud engineering and DevOps**, I have helped organizations modernize infrastructure, automate deployments, and deliver secure, scalable cloud solutions in both Azure and AWS.  

At AFRY and Stena Metall, I automated Azure infrastructure with **Terraform and Azure Pipelines**, cutting manual effort by 40% and improving reliability through KQL-driven monitoring. At Capgemini (Volvo Cars), I built **CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps**, reducing release cycles by 30%, and automated Databricks scaling with Terraform and GitHub Actions. My foundation as a **Linux systems administrator** ensures strong troubleshooting and operational skills across hybrid environments.  

What draws me to Redeploy is your commitment to combining technical depth with client success. I thrive in consultancy environments where curiosity, problem-solving, and collaboration are valued, and I am eager to bring my skills in **automation, CI/CD, and cloud platform engineering** to your team.  

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background can support Redeployâ€™s mission of helping customers unlock the full potential of the cloud.  

Sincerely,  
**Arnab Dey**

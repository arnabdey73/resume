**Hiring Manager**  
Ericsson  

**Subject:** Application for ASIC DevOps â€“ Jenkins Engineer  

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my interest in the ASIC DevOps â€“ Jenkins Engineer position within Ericssonâ€™s Design Verification Methodology team. With over eight years of experience in **DevOps, CI/CD automation, and Linux-based systems**, I bring a proven track record of building reliable automation pipelines and scalable infrastructure that aligns closely with the requirements of this role.  

At AFRY and Stena Metall, I designed and maintained **CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, Azure DevOps, and GitHub Actions**, reducing deployment times by up to 30% and cutting manual effort by 40%. I automated infrastructure provisioning with **Terraform** and improved monitoring and reliability using **KQL-driven dashboards**. In my role at Capgemini (Volvo Cars assignment), I implemented CI/CD automation for **Azure Databricks**, demonstrating the ability to integrate DevOps workflows into complex engineering environments. My foundation as a **Linux systems administrator** at Hewlett Packard has given me strong skills in troubleshooting, scripting with **Python and Bash**, and ensuring high system availability.  

I am particularly motivated by the opportunity at Ericsson to apply these skills to **EDA workflows, Jenkins-based build automation, and silicon design verification**. The chance to contribute to cutting-edge ASIC and FPGA development while collaborating across global R&D teams excites me greatly. I am eager to help Ericsson push the boundaries of CI/CD methodologies, while continuing to grow in areas such as AI/ML-driven workflow optimization and compute cluster efficiency.  

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in **CI/CD, Jenkins automation, and DevOps engineering** can contribute to Ericssonâ€™s next generation of silicon design. Thank you for considering my application.  

Sincerely,  
**Arnab Dey**
